    <h2>Who We Are</h2>

    <p>
      Being from the San Fernando Valley, our goal is to work with other local businesses and help the community around us grow. As the cannabis industry continues to expand, a new responsibility has emerged to manage the resulting cannabis waste accordingly. We at Greenfoot aim to take charge in ensuring all waste accumulated is disposed of properly and compliant with all policies and procedures in our area.

        <h3>How do we operate?</h3>
        <p>
            Greenfoot will provide the needed number of 55-96 gallon drums at drop-off. At scheduled pick-up, all receptacles are then transported and disposed of properly. We offer flexible weekly pick up schedules and affordable payment options to work with your growing business.

          <h3>Giving back</h3>
          <p>
              With our deep roots embedded within the community, a major goal of ours is to be able to give back. As our business grows, we aim to leave a positive footprint in an emerging industry. By giving back a percentage of profits to organizations/charities that benefit our community we help maintain balance in an ever changing industry.
