        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          Being from the San Fernando Valley, our goal is to work with other local businesses and help the community around us grow. As the cannabis industry continues to expand, a new responsibility has emerged to manage the resulting cannabis waste accordingly. We at Greenfoot aim to take charge in ensuring all waste accumulated is disposed of properly and compliant with all policies and procedures in our area.

      <h3>How do we operate?</h3>
      <p>
          With our deep roots embedded within the community, a major goal of ours is to be able to give back. As our business grows, we aim to leave a positive footprint in an emerging industry. By giving back a percentage of profits to organizations/charities that benefit our community we help maintain balance in an ever changing industry.
